Unable to log out so used a unset function to log out manually

Log out php did not actually log out the user, only redirected them to the login page.
Tried a fix: putting the unset function into a loop which checks to see if the user data isn't null
However this still didn't work
Eventually realised there was no session start function and after adding this the code worked as intended.

After creating the Post class an error presented itself saying the newly made class wasn't found in profile.php .
The error was because the classes/post.php file was not included at the start of the the profile.php file. After writing code to include, the page worked as intended.

Once a post was created, if you try to refresh the page and accept the Confirm Form Resubmission prompt, another post with the exact same caption will be uploaded to the database.
This is a usability error which I needed to fix.
Code was written to make sure that once the post was sent to the database, the page was killed and the user redirected to the profile.php page.

While implementing code to display the posts on the profile page an error showed that $posts was undefined. Using var_dump I found out a boolean value was being returned - this is not what we were wanting.
Upon inspection of code I realised that the save function was being used in the classes/post.php doc and not the read function.
After switching save to read the code worked as expected.

When testing the mates section (box that displays other users) a massive error came up.
After debugging it was found out that the include() function was linking to the post.php file instead of the user.php file.
After fixing, the mates section worked as intended.


make sure to link a reference for the user of imagecopyresampled() function

//This is a temporary fix for logging out until the button is implemented
//unset($_SESSION['manoverseUserID']);

//print_r($_SESSION['manoverseUserID']);
//print_r($_SESSION);
